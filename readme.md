

First of all, I would like to mention that I only had 2 days to complete this task. So I mainly worked on the backend to allow users to register for the event and collect the data for later use. The ui ux parts could be better if I had enough time.
Features
Navigation Menu: The top navigation menu contains links to the Home, About Us, and Contact Us (prototypes) pages.
Search Bar: Allows users to search for events using keywords.
Add Events Form: A separate page for adding events for future consideration.
Event List: Displays a list of events, each with a title, description, and a "Register" button.
User Registration: Users can register for events, and their data is collected and stored.
Technologies Used
Backend:
Node.js
Express.js
Frontend:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Database:
MongoDB
MySQL
API Endpoints
Root URL (/): Serves the main page of the application.
Register User (/api/users/register): Accepts a POST request with user data in the request body. Logs the received data in the console and responds with "success".
How to Use
Home Page: Browse the available events listed on the home page.
Search Events: Use the search bar to find specific events using keywords.
Add Events: Navigate to the add events page to include new events for future consideration.
Register for Events: Click the "Register" button next to an event to register. Fill out the registration form and submit.
Limitations
The UI/UX design is minimal due to time constraints.
The navigation links to About Us and Contact Us are prototypes and not fully implemented.
Future Improvements
Enhance the UI/UX design for a better user experience.
Implement full functionality for About Us and Contact Us pages.
Add validation and error handling for user input.
Integrate a more robust search functionality.
